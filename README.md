## Edit Warm Up
Code in `warm up.py` describes a linked list class, that add and remove nodes from the head of the list.

We wish to add a new attribute "self.size" to the class, that will hold the length of the list, and the length can be acquired by `len()` function.

You may test your edited code by running it, it's correct if it can pass the assertion statement.

## Edit for the password generator
Add another randomness into the password generator

Uses import random for namespace cleanliness

Uses list instead of string for 'chars' variable in order to shuffle, increases randomness

Instead of string formatting, uses string concatenation because (currently) it is simpler.
